# Compel Shortcuts

Forces the user to use keyboard shortcuts by blocking mouse clicks on buttons that have keybindings, and displaying a popup of what the keybinding is.

## Known Issues

* Top menu bar actions are not blocked
    * Haven't figured out how to catch those yet.
* Right click menu stays open after blocked click
    * The menu closes when the shortcut is used, but it feels clunky
